# apple-signin-migration-on-app-transfer

When you're in the process of transferring an apps to a different AppStore account, 
it's crucial to ensure that the user data associated with the Apple Sign-in is also properly migrated.
While Apple's official documentation does offer API specifications and detailed explanations, it doesnâ€™t provide
actual code samples.

I have written a set of JavaScript codes to offer a clearer perspective on the migration process,
making it more accessible and straightforward for other developers.

## Before app transfer

1. Find `// TODO: Modify the following parameters to your own` comment and fill in information of your.
2. Run before-app-transfer.js

## After app transfer

1. Find `// TODO: Modify the following parameters to your own` comment and fill in information of your.
2. Run after-app-transfer.js
